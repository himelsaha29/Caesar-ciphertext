# Caesar-ciphertext

This program encrypts text by shifting each letter by some number of places. It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. The user types in the unencrypted "plaintext" and the "key" as input and the output is the encrypted ciphertext created using the key.

(Not a part of this program) The encrypted text is decrypted by shifting the letters of the ciphertext in the opposite direction by the same key.

Usage: ./caesar [key(a positive integer value)]
